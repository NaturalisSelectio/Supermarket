Supermarket
===========

This java program displays an algorithm for consumers in a supermarket. 
It shows the decisions made by a client based on whether or not they are in a hurry and takes into consideration the change of speed at cashiers.

I will add instructions to each file so they would be pretty self explanatory and they are well commented. 

Send me a message if you need help understanding it. 

Feel free to use the files. All I ask is that you give me some credit OK? :)

To run the program you need to download all the files and put them under the same package.
